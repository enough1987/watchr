	<h2 class="additional-pages-main-h">Terms of Use (effective June 1st, 2016)</h2>	
	Welcome to WatchR.  We strive to provide an exceptional experience to our customers.   If you have any questions about how WatchR works or about our Terms of Use, email us at hello@WatchR.com.   We are available 24X7 to answer your questions.
	These Terms of Use are referred to as the “Agreement” and govern all use of the WatchR.com website and mobile application and all content, services, and products provided by WatchR and made available at or through the website or mobile application (individually, a “Service” and collectively, the “Services”). This Agreement sets forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the Services.  WatchR may also offer third party content, products or services which are governed by additional or different terms.  We may refer to ourselves as “WatchR,” “we,” “us” or “our” in this Agreement.  
	<h3 class="additional-pages-sec-h">Summary</h3>
	WatchR is a service that primarily facilitates used watches sales by sellers and purchases by buyers.  As a buyer, WatchR offers you many services and protections, which are described further throughout this Agreement.  For example, all watches offered for sale to buyers have undergone WatchR's multipart pre-purchase watch inspection and meet the requirements applicable in the jurisdictions in which we are a licensed dealer.  Subject to certain restrictions, all WatchR watches come with a 10-day money back guarantee so that you can return a watch for any reason and receive a full refund.  
	WatchR offers many services to sellers as well. In particular, WatchR will professionally inspect and photograph your watch before you agree to list your watch through the Service. Once a buyer reserves your watch through the Service, WatchR will pick up the watch, pay you, and handle the sale and delivery to the buyer.  You will retain that payment even if a buyer returns the watch to WatchR for any reason.
	These features are offered subject to certain restrictions, which are described further throughout this Agreement. Moreover, your use of WatchR's Services imposes certain obligations on you, which are described further below. WatchR strongly encourages you to read this Agreement in its entirety.
	<h3 class="additional-pages-sec-h">General Provisions</h3>
	A.     Registration / Modification
	By registering for and/or using the Services in any manner, you agree that you have read and accepted this Agreement.  The Agreement consists of these terms and conditions, as well as those set forth in WatchR's Privacy Policy. WatchR reserves the right to modify this Agreement at any time and will endeavor to provide notice of modifications at this webpage or by email to registered users.  Any such modification will be evidenced by a new effective date. WatchR may, in its unilateral discretion, change, restrict access to, suspend, or discontinue Services, or any portion thereof.
	In addition to this Agreement, you may be subject to other agreements with WatchR or WatchR’s third party partners if you enter into a transaction using the Services.  For instance, if you purchase a watch using the Services, you will also be subject to a watch purchase or retail installment contract with WatchR, in addition to this Agreement.  Similarly, if you obtain financing through one of WatchR’s third party lending partners, as described more fully in “Obtaining Financing for the Purchase of a watch” below, you will also be subject to various agreements between you and that third party lender. 
	B.     Intended Use
	This website is intended for use only by people of eighteen (18) years of age or older, who have the capacity to enter into a valid contract; by accepting this Agreement, you represent and affirm that you meet these requirements. If you are accepting this Agreement on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to do so.
	C.      Arbitration and Class Action Waiver
	In accordance with the terms set forth below, you agree that disputes between you and us will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration and you waive your right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.
	D.     Sale By Private Sellers/Non-Interference
	This website serves primarily to facilitate sales by private sellers and purchases by private buyers of used watches.  With certain exceptions addressed at Section 4(A) below, the watches offered for sale on the website are offered for sale by the private seller, and not by WatchR. By accepting this Agreement, you represent and affirm that you will not (i) communicate directly with buyers and/or sellers regarding the listed watches; (ii) use the Services to find a buyer or listed watch and then complete a transaction independent of the Services in order to circumvent the obligation to pay any fees related to the Services; or (iii) otherwise interfere with watch listings on the Service without authorization from WatchR.
	<h3 class="additional-pages-sec-h">Access and Use of the Services</h3>
	In order to use and access certain Services, you will be required to register for an account with WatchR (the “Account”). You must provide accurate information and keep your Account information updated. You shall not: (i) select or use as a username a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) use as a username a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization; or (iii) use, as a username, a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your Account, and for keeping your Account password secure. You may never use another person’s user account or registration information for the Services without permission. You must notify us immediately of any change in your eligibility to use the Services, breach of security or unauthorized use of your Account. By registering an Account using your Facebook login credentials, you give us permission to merge your account, and also agree for us to use and publish Facebook information in accordance with the settings you have selected with us and with Facebook.  If you register an Account using your Facebook credentials, you are also subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of Facebook in addition to this Agreement. We are not responsible for any error by Facebook.
	<h3 class="additional-pages-sec-h">Buying and Selling watches</h3>
	In the case of a purchase via our website, the purchaser chooses the watch he or she wants to buy. On completing the order process the purchaser submits a binding offer to conclude a contract of sale to WatchR ("order"). Once WatchR receives an order via the website, the purchaser will receive a message confirming receipt of the order and listing its details. This is an "order confirmation". This order confirmation does not constitute any acceptance of the offer made by the purchaser but merely documents that the order has been received. A contract of sale only comes about when WatchR dispatches the ordered goods to the purchaser. 
	Once the Order has been received, WatchR proceeds to collect the item from the seller, runs a second inspection to double-check authenticity and to make sure no major differences have arisen from the first inspection carried out at the seller’s premises, refurbishes the watch and sends it to the buyer via insure shipping. 
	We may use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill you or compensate you through a payment account linked to your WatchR account.  The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions, and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement.  We are not responsible for error by the Payment Processor.  By choosing to consummate a transaction with WatchR, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge or credit your chosen payment provider.
	A.     Selling a watch Through WatchR.
	With certain exceptions described below, the watches listed for sale through the Service are advertised and offered for sale by private sellers or external, verified dealers, and not by WatchR.
	When seeking to list a watch for sale through the Service, we will ask you, as a prospective seller, to provide basic information regarding the watch, including make, model, year, style, condition, etc.  If the watch meets WatchR’s threshold qualification criteria, you will then be asked to schedule an inspection with a trained WatchR inspector, and to provide certain identifying information, including your name and the location at which the watch will be inspected.  Each seller acknowledges that if he or she provides WatchR with any false, incomplete, or inaccurate information, including but not limited to watch or personal information at any time, any agreement entered into between seller and WatchR for the purchase of a watch by WatchR is null and void and of no force of effect and seller will be responsible to compensate WatchR for any costs, losses or damages resulting from any false, incomplete, or inaccurate information.The costs of collection and shipment of the watch to the shall be borne by WatchR. If the watch offered to WatchR proves to be counterfeit, the seller shall render himself/herself liable for the transportation costs and will be charged £500 fine.
	Once you have provided the required information and scheduled an inspection, WatchR will send one of its trained inspectors to your designated location to photograph the watch, and to conduct a pre-purchase inspection. The inspector will also verify the watch’s make, model, year, style, condition, history and registration.  The inspector will also review the seller’s driver’s ID to confirm that the seller is the owner of the watch.  Any co-owner of the watch must also be present for the inspection and must be verified as the co-owner by WatchR.  The inspection will be conducted by the WatchR inspector in accordance with WatchR’s multipart pre-purchase watch inspection process.
	Upon completing the inspection, if WatchR chooses to allow you to advertise and offer your watch for sale through the Service, WatchR will provide you with a price, determined at WatchR’s sole discretion that will be paid to you in case the watch is sold to a buyer. Prices are fixed and not subject to negotiation, and are based on a variety of factors, including the market value of the watch at the time of inspection, the cost of any needed repairs and refurbishing, in each case as determined by WatchR in its sole discretion.  WatchR is paid a commission in the event a watch is sold. The sale price advertised on WatchR.com is the Guaranteed Price plus WatchR's commission in the event the watch is sold. WatchR’s commission is determined on a watch-by-watch basis by WatchR in its sole discretion. WatchR’s commission is not negotiable.
	Once the watch passes inspection, if the private seller decides to advertise and offer his or her watch for sale through the Service, the watch will be advertised and offered for sale by the private seller at the Guaranteed Price plus WatchR's commission. In offering a watch for sale through the Service, the seller represents that he or she has physical possession of the watch to be sold, and either (a) that he or she has the ability to transfer title, or (b) that he or she has fully disclosed any lien on the watch to WatchR, and has provided WatchR with sufficient information to enable WatchR to satisfy the lien.  Seller agrees to be solely responsible for satisfaction and payment of any liens, claims or damages of any type arising out of the watch during Seller's possession and ownership, including but not limited to medical, personal injury, citation, legal or other claims, and Seller shall indemnify and hold WatchR and the subsequent Buyer harmless of same.
	In addition, by listing a watch though the Service, seller agrees that, unless or until seller advises WatchR that the watch has been sold, or to cancel his or her listing through the Service, the watch is available for sale and, as long as the seller is paid the Guaranteed Price, seller will consummate the sale transaction. The seller is free to continue to use the watch until WatchR arranges for a pickup of the watch and payment of the Guaranteed Price to the seller.   The seller may also continue to list the watch for sale through other outlets, but it is the seller’s responsibility to inform WatchR immediately if the watch is sold.  It is also the seller’s responsibility to inform WatchR of any times during which the watch will be unavailable for pickup. For example, the seller must notify WatchR if he or she is going on vacation and will be unavailable to transfer title and possession while away.
	If the seller fails to notify WatchR that a watch listed through the Service is no longer available for sale or to remove the listed watch prior to a buyer reserving the watch through the Service (referred to as a “Back Out”), Seller agrees that WatchR may charge and seller will pay a “Back Out Fee” not to exceed £500.00.  You also agree that the Back Out Fee will apply if you do not make your watch available for pick up by WatchR within five (5) days of WatchR’s notice to you that the watch has been reserved by a buyer.  In addition, WatchR reserves the right to refuse to accept a watch for listing from a seller with a previous Back Out.
	WatchR may revise the Guaranteed Price in the event of any post-inspection damage. In such a situation, WatchR may – but is not required to – make the seller a new offer on different terms. It is the seller’s responsibility to inform WatchR immediately if any damage occurs to the watch after the inspection by contacting hello@WatchR.com. Should the seller fail to timely inform WatchR of such post-inspection damage, WatchR may, at its sole discretion, remove the listing for the watch and reserves the right to refuse to accept future watches for listing from the seller. The seller also agrees to reimburse WatchR for any costs, losses, or damages suffered as a result, including but not limited to the cost of repair and the cost of any necessary inspection or re-inspection. The nature and extent of any post-inspection damage will be determined solely by WatchR, or a third-party working on WatchR’s behalf.
	WatchR may also revise the Guaranteed Price if the seller publicly offers the watch for sale at a lower price though another outlet.  In such case, the new Guaranteed Price will be the lower offered price. 
	If a buyer reserves a watch advertised and offered for sale through the Service, WatchR will, as soon as reasonably practicable, (1) secure the watch title from the seller or its lien holder, (2) secure all necessary signatures from the seller to accomplish transfer of title, (3) pay the seller for the watch by way of a check issued by WatchR, and (4) pick up the watch from the seller.  WatchR may remove the seller’s listing from the Service if WatchR cannot secure from the seller the title, the watch, or the necessary signatures.  Seller agrees to provide reasonable assistance to WatchR as needed to transfer title to or register the watch to the new buyer.  Should the buyer return the watch to WatchR for any reason, WatchR will retain title and possession of the watch and the seller shall retain the price paid to seller. To the extent such a returned watch is offered for sale through the Service, it will be offered by sale by WatchR.  WatchR may also offer watches it owns or that are in its possession for sale through the Service.
	WatchR cannot guarantee that any watch listed through the Service will be sold. Nor can WatchR guarantee the length of time it will take for any watch to sell.  WatchR may, in its sole discretion, remove a listing from the Service if the watch is not sold within thirty (60) days. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in rare instances, if WatchR makes an error in quoting a Guaranteed Price that would result in a windfall to the seller (e.g. offering a price close to or above the new watch price for a watch), WatchR may revise the Guaranteed Price in its sole discretion.  
	B.     Buying a watch through WatchR.
	Following registration for access and use of the Services, a prospective buyer is free to browse watch listings. For each watch offered for sale, the Service displays photographs and certain characteristics of the watch. The photographs displayed are not exemplars, but photos of the actual watch offered for sale.
	Each of the watches offered for sale through the Service is certified by WatchR pursuant to its multistep pre-purchase certification process. 
	With respect to any watch WatchR sells, WatchR will have complied with applicable state law regarding the inspection and mechanical operation of the watch.  WatchR will also make all disclosures required under applicable state and federal law WatchR will publish through the Service any third party report it has secured with respect to an individual watch. WatchR disclaims any responsibility for the accuracy of any such report.
	The price on a watch listing (the “Listing Price”) includes WatchR’s commission, but does include taxes, title, registration, delivery fees (if any), other applicable fees.  The final purchase price of the watch (the “Sale Price”) is calculated at the time you reserve the watch through the Service and determined based on the location to which the watch will be delivered. Prior to reserving a watch on WatchR.com a prospective buyer must enter his or her postcode, after which the applicable taxes, title, registration and delivery fees are calculated and added to the sales price to show the buyer the total amount of the purchase.  Taxes, title and registration may vary by city and by country.  WatchR may apply a delivery charge for transporting watches from one WatchR location to another or for watches delivered outside of its then current delivery zones. In addition, should a buyer elect to make an additional purchase (e.g. a watch service contract), those charges will also be calculated and displayed to the buyer when he or she navigates through the watch reservation process.
	The buyer and WatchR will mutually execute appropriate sales agreement(s) memorializing the terms of the sale. A buyer can pay for the watch by check, credit card, debit card, Paypal or bank transfer. Payment is due at the time reservation of the watch. While WatchR expects to be able to offer delivery within several days of most purchases, there are certain circumstances outside of WatchR’s control that may delay delivery. For example, if the seller is out of town, WatchR may be unable to obtain the watch until the seller returns. Accordingly, WatchR cannot offer a guaranteed delivery timeframe at the time of reservation and quoted delivery times are subject to change.
	Each watch sold by WatchR comes with a 10-day money back guarantee. This means that, as long as the watch is in the same condition it was in at the time of delivery (collectively the “Money Back Guarantee Conditions”), a buyer can, within 10 days of delivery, return the watch to WatchR and receive a full refund.  As long as the Money Back Guarantee Conditions are satisfied, the buyer may return the watch for any reason within 10 days of delivery. WatchR does not offer partial refunds and will not renegotiate the purchase price if the buyer is not satisfied with the watch. In the event the buyer is not satisfied with the watch for any reason, the buyer may, as long as the Money Back Guarantee Conditions are satisfied, return the watch within ten days of purchase and receive a full refund. 
	To the extent the watch has been damaged following delivery to the buyer, or is otherwise in worse condition than it was at the time of delivery, WatchR, in its sole discretion, may refuse to refund any portion of the purchase price, or may choose to reduce the refunded amount by the amount required to return the watch to its condition at the time of delivery to buyer. The amount of the deduction will be determined by WatchR in its sole discretion, and WatchR will provide an accounting to the buyer reflecting the amount of any deductions and the reason for each deduction.
	<h3 class="additional-pages-sec-h">WatchR’s Limited Warranty</h3>
	Our pre-owned watches are accompanied either by our Limited 12 month warranty (the "Warranty") from the day you receive your watch, protecting your watch against manufacturing and mechanical defects, subject to the following terms and conditions. Our warranty does not cover new watches.

The conclusion in the report to be provided by the third party will be binding as between the parties. Please note that the recommendations of the manufacturer are expressly excluded for the purposes of our Warranty, where such recommendations conflict with our advice.

	If you are based outside of the United Kingdom, you may have to pay import duty or other taxes, fees and charges applied by customs or other authorities of your country for work done under Warranty, particularly if you do not correctly complete the relevant declarations.

	Please note that you must securely deliver the watch to our service centre as advised and with adequate insurance, whether for the health check or to claim against your Warranty or for any other reason, which shall be your responsibility and at your cost unless stated otherwise.
